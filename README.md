# FMP_CC-CSP
Reposetori for a final master project of Pau Carab√≠. 

Here are presnted the 3 main scripts programmed by the student. The pipe line would be:
- Run VEP over the ClinVar data.
- Run hail_parsing.py on the ClinVar annotated chromosomes.
- Run cleaning_data_pandas.py on the chromosomes outputed by the anterior script.
- Run nn_pytorch.py which runs the neural netork and creates graphs and figures.

Graphs created during the gird search found in ROC_curve, loss_graph and confusion_matrix folders.
